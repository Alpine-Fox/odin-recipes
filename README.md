The following repo is a project from following [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) "Foundations" course.

## What is this project?
The main goal is to create a basic recipe website. 

The landing page will have a list of a couple recipes, with links leading to the actual recipe. 

At the time of writing this (12/26/2024) I have not yet learned CSS, so this site will not look good. Later throughout this course, I will re-visit this project.
